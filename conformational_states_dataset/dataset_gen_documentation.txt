for each uniprot in the conformation cluster pipeline
if there is a pdb in openprotein for AT LEAST TWO clusters
calculate rmsd between pdb1 and pdb2 where pdb1 is cluster 1 and pdb2 is clutser 2
if the rmsd(pdb1,pdb2) >= 15, this is a candidate

conformational_states_df_filtered_rmsd_seg_len = conformational_states_df %>% filter(rmsd_wrt_pdb_id_ref >= 15)  %>% filter(seg_len >= 150) %>% filter(seg_len <= 500) %>% as.data.frame()

#manual filtering criteria:
#visible conformational change NOT confined to a (low confidence, i.e predicted disordered) linker/loop/tail  




for ML dataset:
take each openfold prediction
determine which pdb is further
remove disrodered residues
and make sure the protein has same number of residues as other pdb
so chop off any terminal residues
